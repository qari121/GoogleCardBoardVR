The status of faliure is totally simulated and random if it fails keep retrying and it will be successful.

The game manager spawns a player in the main screen  if the player creation was successful.

This is made from the what I understood best from the documentation it could be better if it was 
explained a bit more perhaps ;)

Looking forward to hearing from this was very much fun!

Thanks!
